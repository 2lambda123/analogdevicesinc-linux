v2:

- driver
 * Add Docs to index.rst 
 * Removed ltc4282_power_on() - Not very reasonable to enable/disable an hot swap from the driver
 * Removed struct device *dev parameter from struct ltc4282_state
 * Error out for rsense-nano-ohms < 100
 * Return 0 on .is_visible() - not a negative error 
 * Moved to 80 column limit
 * Replace ENOTSUPP with EOPNOTSUPP
 * Remove Power Average (Should be done in userspace) - With it, no
need for handling energy + tick overflows
 * Return 0 instead of 'ret' in ltc4282_read_energy()
 * Add adi prefix to 'vin-mode-microvolt'
 * Changed 'adi,current-limit-microvolt' to 'adi,current-limit-sense-microvolt' so
it's clear the device expects volts to be configured
 * Moved fault logs to debugfs while adding a new interface to clear all faults in
one write
 * Keep historic alarms in ltc4282_read_alarm()
 * Cache energy status so we don't have to read it from the device on every energy
value read
 * Use enable attributes to switch between VDD - VSOURCE.
 * Support reset_history.
 * Sync with bindings - use strings properties
