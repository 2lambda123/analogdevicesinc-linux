description: |
  The MAX30210 operates from 1.7V to 2.0V supply voltage, and is a low-power,
  high-accuracy digital temperature sensor with ±0.1°C accuracy from +20°C to
  +50°C and ±0.15°C accuracy from -20°C to +85°C.

  vdd-supply:
    description:
      Must have values in the interval (1.7V; 5.5V) in order for the device to
      function correctly.

  adi,external-convert-enable:
    description:
      It can be used for both an external conversion input (CVT) and powering
      down (PDB) the part to reduce current in between temperature conversions.
    type: boolean

  adi,ext-conv-rising-edge:
    description:
      It is used to set the active edge of the external conversion input to
      rising. By default, the active edge is falling.
    type: boolean

  adi,comp-int:
    description:
      If present comparator mode is used. If not present interrupt mode is used
      (default).
    type: boolean
