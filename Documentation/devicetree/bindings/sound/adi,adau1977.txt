This driver supports both the I2C and SPI bus.

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should contain one of the following:
               "adi,adau1977"
               "adi,adau1978"
               "adi,adau1979"

 - AVDD-supply: analog power supply for the device, please consult
                Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt

Optional properties:
 - reset-gpio:  the reset pin for the chip, for more details consult
                Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpio/gpio.txt

 - DVDD-supply: supply voltage for the digital core, please consult
                Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt

 - MICBIAS-supply: only for ADAU1977, specifies the voltage settings via
                the regulator framework. Please consult
                Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt

                The supported voltages are 5.0V, 5.5V, 6.0V, 6.5V, 7.0V,
                7.5V, 8.0V, 8.5V, 9.0V.
                When specifying a value in the regulator (e.g. 5400000 uV) the
                closest or rounded value from the supported voltages will
                be used.
                Examples:
                  for anything lower than 5000000 uV, 5.0V will be used
                  for values in range 5750001 - 6249000 uV, 6.0V will be used
                  for values in range 6250001 - 6500000 uV, 6.5V will be used
                  for anything above 9000000 uV, 9.0V will be used

For required properties on SPI, please consult
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-bus.txt

Required properties on I2C:

 - reg:         The i2c address. Value depends on the state of ADDR0
                and ADDR1, as wired in hardware.

Examples:

	adau1977_spi: adau1977@0 {
		compatible = "adi,adau1977";
		spi-max-frequency = <600000>;

		AVDD-supply = <&regulator>;
		DVDD-supply = <&regulator_digital>;
		MICBIAS-supply = <&regulator_micbias>;

		reset_gpio = <&gpio 10 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
	};

	adau1977_i2c: adau1977@11 {
		compatible = "adi,adau1977";
		reg = <0x11>;

		AVDD-supply = <&regulator>;
		DVDD-supply = <&regulator_digital>;
		MICBIAS-supply = <&regulator_micbias>;

		reset_gpio = <&gpio 10 GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW>;
	};
