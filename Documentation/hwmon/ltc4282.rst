Description
___________

The LTC4282 hot swap controller allows a board to be safely inserted and removed
from a live backplane. Using one or more external N-channel pass transistors,
board supply voltage and inrush current are ramped up at an adjustable rate. An
I2C interface and onboard ADC allows for monitoring of board current, voltage,
power, energy and fault status. The device features analog foldback current
limiting and supply monitoring for applications from 2.9V to 33V. Dual 12V gate
drive allows high power applications to either share safe operating area across
parallel MOSFETs or support a 2-stage start-up that first charges the load
capacitance followed by enabling a low on-resistance path to the load. The
LTC4282 is well suited to high power applications because the precise monitoring
capability and accurate current limiting reduce the extremes in which both loads
and power supplies must safely operate. Non-volatile configuration allows for
flexibility in the autonomous generation of alerts and response to faults.

Sysfs entries
_____________

The following attributes are supported. Limits are read-write and all the other
attributes are read-only. The sysfs interface might depend on the Firmware configuration.
The default below is the default interface.
